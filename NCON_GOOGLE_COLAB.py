  # so we are just altering and loading the previous alteration to alter it furthur. here i replace the line breaks with dollar sign

  # IMPORTANT so i don't know how to delete the last tab (\t) but this script will produce a tab at the end that you can manually remove way at the end 
  # so remember before importing to Nvivo REMOVE THE LAST EMPTY SPACE which is just a tab press or "\t"
