# Youtube-.SBV-to-NVIVO
I'm a super noob this is my first script ever that i did. so quit your snigering!

Here is a script that will help you turn youtube captions (.sbv) files to a text files which you can import as rows to transcribe a video in NVIVO. 

the NCON.PY has very clear instructions on how what each line does 

i ran this using anaconda, but you can use google colab just make sure you upload the .sbv file to the "/content/captions.sbv" and your good to go i have included a seperate py file for google colab

have fun and if you fix any of my problems please let me know i would like to learn how to do it better.

May the source be with you.
