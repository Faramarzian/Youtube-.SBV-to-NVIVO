# Youtube-.SBV-to-NVIVO
I'm a super noob this is my first script ever that i did. so quit your snigering!

Here is a script that will help you turn youtube captions (.sbv) files to a text files which you can import as rows to transcribe a video in NVIVO. 

the NCON.PY has very clear instructions on how what each line does 

i ran this using anaconda, but you can use google colab just make sure you upload the .sbv file to the "/content/captions.sbv" and your good to go i have included a seperate py file for google colab

have fun and if you fix any of my problems please let me know i would like to learn how to do it better.

IMPORTANT. At the end of the output file there is an extra tab or "\t" which i don't know how to remove you just have to remove it manually. 
so you would have to open the text file, scroll to the end and delete the last empty space and save it. 

if you are not a programmer here is a video
